# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Module 18 - Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Rist

## Overview of the analysis

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
